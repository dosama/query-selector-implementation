        The stark reality is that cyber-attacks are now commonplace. The
        adversaries are smart, highly-organized and adept at making changes to
        side-step attempts to stop them. Security professionals are expected to
        plan and prepare not only for existing threats but also ones that may
        emerge in the future. This is a daunting task. After all, it’s not
        feasible or economically viable for governments or enterprises to
        protect against every single exploit or threat vector. Instead, it’s
        about the smart allocation of resources to strengthen the security
        posture against the attacks most likely to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        By harnessing the power of <mark>cyber threat intelligence</mark>,
        governments and enterprises are able to cut across the noise and discern
        the most relevant threats to them. With a Threat Intelligence Platform
        (TIP) analysts are able to generate actionable intelligence. Precise and
        accurate threat intelligence helps drive better informed strategic,
        tactical and operational decisions, ensuring the most effective remedial
        action is implemented. The result is that the impact of breaches on the
        organization is minimized.
      </p>
      <p>
        EclecticIQ Platform is the analyst-centric TIP. It ingests intelligence
        data from open sources, commercial suppliers and industry partnerships
        into a single collaborative analyst workbench. EclecticIQ Platform
        eliminates the manual and repetitive work involved with processing
        multiple intelligence feeds, allowing analysts to identify the most
        critical threats, take timely action, advise the organization on how to
        respond, and collaborate with industry peers. EclecticIQ Platform is
        based on industry best practice, compatible with <mark>STIX</mark> &
        <mark>TAXII</mark>, and developed with CTI workflows and tradecraft at
        its core.

        In today’s environment with multiple suppliers and providers of threat
        intelligence, it’s nearly impossible to manually comb through thousands
        of daily alerts and understand which are the most important. However,
        being able to correlate the various acquired data sources and feeds will
        help you identify patterns of activity and key points within the threat
        data. This fusion of different intelligence sources is a pre-requisite
        for any analysis and for any effective course of action. After all, it’s
        only when you have a comprehensive view of your threat landscape that
        you understand how to best allocate your resources and align your IT
        security to the most relevant threats. The challenge is that it’s a
        complex and time-consuming process to understand which ones are best for
        your business and remove the false positives in an attempt to identify
        what is relevant to you. An additional, sometimes forgotten, overhead is
        the commercial negotiations and day-to-day management of the numerous
        intelligence source suppliers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Threat analysts are hard to find. Indeed, for some organizations
        analysts are a resource they know they need but simply can’t afford.
        Whether you rely on external resources or your own in-house team,
        analysts need cutting-edge, structured, curated intelligence to let them
        to focus on what matters most to your organization. With properly
        aggregated multi-source data it’s easier for analysts to better
        anticipate threats, advise pertinent courses of action and mitigate
        exposures. Removing the repetitive aspects of fusing the multiple
        sources of intelligence, allows analysts to spend their time and energy
        on what they excel at, which maximizes the business value of your Cyber
        Threat Intelligence (CTI) investment.
      </p>

      <h3 class="section-heading">STIX</h3>
      <p>
        STIX (Structured Threat Information eXpression) is a standardized
        language which has been developed by <span class="project">MITRE</span> in a collaborative way in
        order to represent structured information about cyber threats. It has
        been developed so it can be shared, stored, and otherwise used in a
        consistent manner that facilitates automation and human assisted
        analysis.
      </p>
      <h3 class="section-heading">TAXII</h3>
      <p>
        TAXII (Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information) is a
        collection of services and message exchanges to enable the sharing of
        information about cyber threats across product, service and
        organizational boundaries. It is a transport vehicle for STIX structured
        threat information and key enabler to widespread exchange.
